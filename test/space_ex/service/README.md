# Service tests

The kRPC API is dynamically defined by API JSON files, and that definition
includes 1000+ procedures, along with many enumerations and classes.

There's no reasonable way to comprehensively test it, especially since doing so
would make life difficult when the API is updated in future versions.

Fortunately, since all that API is automatically generated by the same
`SpaceEx.Gen` code, we only really need to cover a representative sample of the
API -- enough to ensure the generator is doing its job, and each generation
case is covered.

I've tried to pick a selection of calls that are the most fundamental and
longest lived, so as to avoid needing changes in the future.
